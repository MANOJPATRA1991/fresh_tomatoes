### Description
Inside the **`fresh_tomatoes`** directory, we have a **`movies`** folder which contains **`entertainment_center.py`**, **`media.py`** and **`my_movies.py`** files.

**`my_movies.py`** writes html, css and javascript required to run the website to the **`fresh_tomatoes.html`** file.

**`media.py`** contains the Movie class with the help of which instances of type Movie can be created.

**`entertainment_center.py`** is the file where we create Movie instances and that when executed runs the program and opens the website on a web browser.

To run the program, open **`entertainment_center.py`** with **IDLE(Python 3.6)** and then **Run -> Run Module** or press **F5** for instant execution.
